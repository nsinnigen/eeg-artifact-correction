# eeg-artifact-correction
As part of my master's thesis, I proposed this Matlab-based online algorithm for correcting EOG and EMG artifacts of high-density EEG signals at high sampling rates in real time, while preserving neural brain activity information. Its performance can improve EEG neurofeedback during fMRI measurements and may be suitable for other BCI.
